# shellcheck shell=bash
# Which manifests Dependabot is watching, and which tracked ones it is not.
# Sourced by scripts/doctor, which reports the gap.
#
# Sourced, never executed: no shebang, no executable bit, a .sh extension so
# linters recognize it. The same rule libs/detect.sh follows, for the same
# reason.
#
# This is not in libs/detect.sh. That module owns language-specific decisions
# and is dispatched by language_capabilities, which answers whether a language
# is present from its *root* manifest. The question here is a different one --
# where every manifest sits, including the nested ones a root workspace file
# points at -- and the answer is a path rather than a yes.
#
# The gap this closes is silent. Dependabot's security half reads the
# dependency graph and needs no entry, so a dependency with an advisory still
# gets a pull request; a dependency with nothing yet wrong with it never does,
# and ages until something is. Nothing else reports it: the file is valid YAML,
# the config's own check run is green -- it validates the schema and never opens
# the directories the entries name -- and the only visible symptom is a bump
# that never arrives.
#
# Both ways of being wrong are quiet, so the parsing below is written against
# both. Reading an entry that is not there reports a gap that does not exist,
# and an operator who is told twice to derive an entry already present learns to
# skip the line. Missing an entry that is there is worse: it reports the
# manifest watched, which is the silence this module exists to break.

# The manifest filenames Dependabot reads, and the package-ecosystem each one
# earns: dependabot_ecosystem_of <basename>, empty for anything else.
#
# Deliberately the same six languages the rest of the template detects, and the
# same six the mapping table in apps/repo-builder/src/references/lifecycle.md
# states. A seventh recognized here and nowhere else is a shape no other check
# can see, so a manifest outside this list is reported by a /repo-builder flow
# on its own gate rather than mapped here.
#
# go.work and settings.gradle.kts are absent on purpose. They are workspace
# files: they say where the modules are, and the modules are what Dependabot
# reads. Mapping one would derive an entry at the workspace root, and what
# becomes of such an entry is the service's own discovery behaviour rather than
# a fixed rule -- go.work discovery was merged into dependabot-core in
# dependabot/dependabot-core#14909 on 2026-05-05, a date on the engine rather
# than on its rollout. Mapping manifests and nothing else is the rule that does
# not have to track which ecosystem gained it when.

# The (ecosystem, directory) pairs the config watches, one per line, tab
# separated. A `directories` list contributes one pair per member.
#
# Parsed rather than grepped, for the reason libs/precommit.sh gives at length.
# Four shapes are all valid YAML for the same configuration and an edit or a
# formatter turns one into another, so a reader that understands only some of
# them is wrong about a file nobody has broken:
#
#   - `directory` and `directories`, singular and plural.
#   - a block list, a flow list, and a flow list wrapped across lines.
#   - `package-ecosystem` anywhere in its entry rather than first. Mapping keys
#     are unordered in YAML, so an entry that opens with `schedule:` is the same
#     entry -- and reading the key position rather than the entry boundary
#     attributes the second entry's directory to the first entry's ecosystem,
#     which reports a real gap as watched.
#   - a blank or comment line inside a block list, which separates members
#     rather than ending the list.
#
# A comment is stripped before the line is read, so the prose at the top of the
# file -- which names every ecosystem, including the ones no entry lists --
# cannot be mistaken for configuration.
